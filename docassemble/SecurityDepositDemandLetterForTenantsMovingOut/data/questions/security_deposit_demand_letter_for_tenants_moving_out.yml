  Security Deposit Demand Letter for Tenants Moving Out
subquestion: |
  This form will help you draft a demand letter to send to your landlord if 
  they have not returned your security deposit within 30 days after your
  lease ended. If your landlord does not return your deposit, you may get
  up to 3 times your deposit back from your landlord as a penalty.
  
  Before you start, you will need information about your landlord and their 
  address.
  
  If you lived with other people and you each paid your portion of the
  security deposit seperately, you should each send your own Demand Letter. 
   
  You may choose send this letter to your landlord via certified mail, but it
  is not required. Further instructions for the next steps after this letter
  has been sent can be found at the end of the form.
